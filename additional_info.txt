getRawCategoryData -> rawcategorydata{time1}.csv -> processRawCategoryData{time1} -> processedcategorydata{time1} -> curateCategoryData ->
curatedCategoryData{time1} -> insertDatatoDb -> Postgres
			   -> curatedCategoryData{time1} -> createCategoryGroups -> SQS messages -> getRawStreamData

ISSUES DISCOVERED
- calling get stream endpoint might lead to weird streams like where user_id is "testdocument" or and language is "testbroadcastlanguage"
- there is no category id and the stream id is literally a single digit
- sometimes insertdatatodb fails since foreign key constraint not satisfied where category in stream does not exist in categories
- this is due to curatecategorydata function ending due to reaching max time allotted due to taking too much time uploading new_categories_data.csv
- curated_categories.csv was able to be uploaded but not new_categories_data.csv
- as a result, the lambda function restarted, finding no new categories since curated_categories was updated, so new_categories_data.csv was empty when it shouldn't
have been
